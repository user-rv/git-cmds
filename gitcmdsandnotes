lets know in detail regarding git

in real time , many developers work on diff things like front end development(interfac), backend development(functionality) etc.,To cascaade everyone's processand 
classify we use git.

there are two work spaces 
local ws
remote ws

we(developers)work at local ws, will make necessary modifications and  will get access to remote ws by cloning.

all modified or new files will be stored in a respository in remote ws

indetail:  > create a respository(git-cmds) at github and get ssh url from code 

inlocal machine : get ssh key -< ssh-keygen>

key will be generated. move  to ssh dir  <cd .ssh> and view content of ssh dir <ls -ltr>
you will get know where pub key is stored <cat *absolutepath>
key will be displayed, copy the key and paste it at remote ws

get installed git <sudo yum install git> 
as we know the ssh url , clone the respository < git clone *sshurl>
by cloning , a new  respository (dir) will be created at local machine
 
move to that dir and make necessary modifications by creating new files if needed
we can check the status of git flow by <git status>

#all the files will be added
`git add .`

#all added files will be commited to that particular respository
git commit -m "messages" 

#all files which we have modified and created will be reflected at remote ws.
git push 

this is how git cmd and  github will be used in realtime
